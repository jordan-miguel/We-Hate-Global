// Here we are creating seperate self calling closures for independent pieces of 
// functionality.
// Essentially, each closure can be thought of as an 'individual' module that adds
// some type of functionality to the application without being reliant on anything
// outside it (which we don't want for obvious reasons).

// This keeps the global namespace just about untouched.
